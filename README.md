* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - a free web-based Git hosting service
* [Atlassian Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - another free web-based Git hosting service
* [Gitlab at MITRE](https://gitlab.mitre.org/) - like GitHub, but inside MITRE
* [MITRE Atlassian Portal](https://login.codev.mitre.org/portal) - log in to access MITRE Codev tools
    * [Atlassian Stash](https://git.codev.mitre.org/) - like Gitlab but requires access
	
## What even is Git?
* *Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.*
* Makes it easy to manage project versions, among one or many authors
* Popular

## What is a Git "repo"?
* "repo" stands for "repository"
* A data structure with information to manage a project
* To get a repo, **clone** it

## What is GitHub?
* A web-based Git hosting service
* Free
* Hosts important open source projects like: [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs), [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs), [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery), [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is similar

## Before Git...
* *Mary, Jim, and Sarah work on a project.*
* **Jim**: I've made my changes. I emailed you a zip file of the project.
* **Sarah**: Got it. I'm making my changes now.
* **Mary**: Sarah- I'll stop by with a USB stick to copy your files.
* **Jim**: I have more changes, but I'll wait for Mary to finish.

## After Git...
* **Jim**: My changes are in.
* **Sarah**: I saw that. I already merged my changes.
* **Mary**: I just pulled the latest version. My changes will be in shortly.
* **Jim**: I just pushed in more changes, but it won't affect either of you.

# Getting Git

## You may already have it.
```sh
user@yourmachine:~$ git --version
```

## Download it: [link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# **Lab 1 - Create a GitHub Repository**
* Go to [GithHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account
* For now, consider everything **public**
* Create a new repository
    * Name it **helloworld**
	* Add a *Description*
    * Select *Public*
	* Check *Initialize this repository with a README*
* Find the HTTPS and SSH URLs to clone the repository (you will need this later)

# Git Concepts
* Make changes in your local computer's repo, then push them to the remote repo
* Developers have all revisions of the code, since the most recent *pull*
* There are three areas: working directory (local), staging area (local), and repository host (remote)
* You add files to be versioned, modify/delete files, commit changes to the staging area, and push files to the remote repository for all to see.


# Basic Git Commands

## git clone
* Clone(copy) the remote repository to your local computer
* Creates a local folder with the same name as your remote repo
* You can now make changes locally and push them to the remote server
* You need the HTTPS or SSH URL to clone a repo
* Syntax:

```sh
user@yourmachine:~$ git clone https://github.com/CoachEd/helloworld.git
```
* Note the new *helloworld* folder on your computer
* Add, modify, or delete files and folders in the local repo (helloworld folder)

## git status
* See the current status of your local repo
* Are there new files/folders not currently versioned?
* Are there any changes to existing files/folders?
* Are there any deleted files/folders?
* Are there any changes that need to be committed to the staging area?
* Is there anything in the staging area that needs to be pushed to the remote repo?
* Syntax:

```sh
user@yourmachine:~$ git status
```

## git add

## git commit

## git push
