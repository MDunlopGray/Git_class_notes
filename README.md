## Before Git...
* *Mary, Jim, and Sarah work on a project.*
* **Jim**: I've made my changes. I emailed you a zip file of the project.
* **Sarah**: Got it. I'm making my changes now.
* **Mary**: Sarah- please email me a zip file when you're done.
* **Jim**: I have more changes, but I'll wait for Mary to finish.

## After Git...
* **Jim**: My changes are in.
* **Sarah**: I saw that. I already merged my changes.
* **Mary**: I just pulled the latest version. My changes will be in shortly.
* **Jim**: I just pushed in more changes, but it won't affect either of you.
